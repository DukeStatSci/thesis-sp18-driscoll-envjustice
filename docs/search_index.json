As such, the literature has focused on neighborhood level studies, working hand in hand with organizers to assess and understand micro-level toxcicity disparity patterns in communities. As an injustice inherent to the societal structure of our nation, environmental justice questions need to be addressed at a national scale to truly gain an understanding of where we have been and where we are going. The Risk Screening Environmental Indicator model (RSEI) data was released for public use in 2015, opening a window to work with fine grain toxicity data available nationally since 1988. Combining RSEI toxicity data with Census demographic data allows the creation of empircal distributions of toxicity experienced by any subset of the American public. Improving on past binary measures of pollution exposure, with data on an extended time period, we are able to broach more systematic questions. Specifically we look at: the overall geography of toxicity in America; how the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of toxicity experienced by each race group varies over time; and how protective higher incomes are for differing race groups. Through creating toxicity distributions for minority and low-income groups over the 23 year period, we are able to see how toxicity burdens change over time, and how changes were distributed over different groups. Results show that toxicity is decreasing dramatically for all, and though the gap is closing, there still remains a large difference in toxicity experienced between white and minority groups.

["1-env-justice.html", "Chapter 1 Environmental Justice 1.1 Environmental Justice Theories 1.2 Goals", " Chapter 1 Environmental Justice 1.1 Environmental Justice Theories The growing body of environmental literature has shown with increasing certainty that minorities in America experience a higher poullution level on average than the white population. The literature has focused primarily on air pollution and industrial facilities releases, the two areas with the most consistently accessible data. Many authors have focused on point source pollution, measuring individual pollution as a binary: the presence or absence of a polluting facility in the geographic level of analysis (Szasz and Meuser, 1997). An alternate measure of pollution exposure has been the count of polluting facilities within various buffer zones. These measures, limited by available data, fail to account for the variance in what chemicals, and how much of them, facilities emit. Alternate approaches include data on transportation emissions, and broader environmental data, like levels of NO2 and PM2.5. Environmental justice literature results are not all in agreement. Many studies conclude that minorities do experience a disproportionate toxicity or pollution burden (Gilbert and Chakraborty, 2011; Fisher, Kelly and Romm, 2006; Kravitz-Wirtz et al., 2016), others find that economic class accounts for most of the difference in experienced toxicity (Anderton et al., 1994), yet others find no racial differences (Hunter et al., 2003; Downey, 2007). The incredibly heterogeneous results have led to some dissent in the academic community with some saying that all the field has achieved is to show that “in some specific areas, some ostensibly identifiable groups may, in some instances, live closer to some selected environmental hazards” (Bowen, 2002). Environmental justice research is unique in that research and advocacy have gone hand in hand, leading to questions guided by the needs of communities. This trend has led to unusually focused work, evaluating specific communities for the presence of specfic toxins at specific times (Sadd et al., 1999; US GAO, 1893; Moghadam and Kayahan, 2017; Gilbert and Chakraborty, 2011). Though some work has had a broader net, few authors have broached national data (Ringquist, 1997; Hunter et al., 2003) and even fewer have used data spanning significant time (Kravitz-Wirtz et al., 2016). Due to the definitions of pollution being used, uncertainty in accessible pollution data, and differing geographic units of analysis, work spanning broader time periods as well as a wider geographic range is neccessary to try to understand processes operating on a national scale that lead to environmental inequality. Despite differing conclusions from the collective body of research, how we define and think about environmental justice is evolving. Alongside descriptive studies that investigate specific pollution trends, theories of how environmental injustices are created have arisen. The main theorized explanations for environmental injustice are economic, sociopolitical and discriminatory explanations. 1.1.1 Economic Explanations Theories focusing on economic explanations for environmental inequality rely on individual rational choice as an explanation. Especially in the case of point source pollution, companies must make economically rational decisions when siting facilities. Those decisions can be multifaceted: if the location has easy access to transportation, or is close to raw materials, but a primary concern is cost of land. Given companies want cheap land for polluting facilities, and minority communities tend to be near cheap land (Anderton et al., 1994), it’s rational that there would be more facility siting in minority areas. In the same vein, it would be economically rational for those with the means to escape newly sited pollution to do so (Hunter et al., 2003). Under this theory, cheaper land is more likely to be near minority communities, facilities will be sited there, and those who can afford to escape do so, devaluing the land further, and making it all the more attractive for facility siting. Despite the direct cause and effect theorized, results have been mixed. Several studies found that more facilities were sited in minority communities (Crowder and Downey, 2010), while others didn’t (Pais et al., 2013). 1.1.2 Sociopolitical Explanations An alternate explanation still relies upon siting decisions, but is more explicitly exploitative. Sociopolitical explanations theorize that companies rationaly chose to site in minority communities, as they will provide less resistance. At risk communities would show a lower voter turnout, have a large older population, may be disproportionately renters, and may be poorly politically represented. In theory, communities with lower organizing potential are more attractive for facility siting, as they pose a low risk of creating political or economic resistence to the proposed facility. 1.1.3 Racial Discrimination Racial discrimination theories are divided in to overt and insitutional racism theories. In discussion of these theories the language used tends to change, using the term ‘environmental racism’ rather than ‘environmental justice’. The overt discrimination theory speculates on the intentions of the individuals making the final siting decisions. In this case, overt racism refers to the siting decisions as choices made intentionally to cause strife to minority communities or protect wealthy white communities. The intstitutional discrimination theory relies primarily on housing dynamics. Based on the knowledge that the number of minority individuals living near a sited facility has risen since first measured (Crowder et al., 2010), the theory states that minorities move towards polluting facilities due to reduced choice in the housing market. Reduced choice can arise in several ways: the choices realtors make in showing homes or the availability of mortgages or loans. Local governments can compound the problems with housing, as minority areas are more likely to be rezoned for industrial purposes by local government (Pais et al., 2013). These three theories all boil down to the same outcome. Despite using different language and justifications all represent different forms of instutional discrimination. Economic explanations rely on the segregation of minority communites created by redlining. Redlining destroyed investment in communities, prevented black families from investing in homes, and enforced segregated communities. Redlining created the geography and culture that enables economic and sociopolitical explanation, making it a consequence of previous overt discrimination. Though the current theories of siting choices would all create the same behaviour, the different reasonings can help to explain (and perhaps change) the trends that lead to environmental injustice. 1.2 Goals This work aims to address some of the limitations of the current environmental justice literature by examining a comprehensive dataset that covers the entire nation, with data spanning from 1990 to 2013. The broad temporal and spatial is nearly unparalleled in environmental justice literature, the last study spanning this length period covered the years 1970 to 1994 (Been and Gupta, 1997), which relied only upon tract level hazardous waste site data. Several questions will be addressed: - Finding the empirical fifth, fiftieth, and ninety fifth percentiles of experienced toxicity for white, black, and hispanic populations. - Simulating how minority distributions would currently look given they had held constant their relative position in the overall distributions. This measure acts allows us to see how much of the improvement we see is attributable to the compression of the full distribution, and how much improvement is attributable to an improvment in the relative state of minority groups. - An initial analysis of how income, and it’s coincidence with minority status, is related to experienced toxicity.

["2-data.html", "Chapter 2 Data 2.1 Raw Data 2.2 Important Caveats 2.3 Consistency in Reporting (detailed data description) 2.4 Ultimate Data Form", " Chapter 2 Data 2.1 Raw Data The Risk Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) Model is a geographically detailed data set produced by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). RSEI data is based upon the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), which collects data on toxic releases in the US. The TRI program manages the regulations, policies and facilities that ultimately are mandated to be reported. TRI data is self reported by facilities, with each observation being a release of a reporting chemical at a reporting facility. For each observation, data is collected on which chemical was released, how much of it was released, and the facility from which it was released. The detailed location and chemical data that is collected through TRI is reformatted through a fate and transport model to create RSEI. The RSEI data shows where each release has traveled on an 800m grid across the USA. The ultimate data we have access to through the RSEI data is an observation for each release, for each square in the grid that the release hits. This gives us an idea of how the chemicals spread from the release locations, and enables us to create a map across the entire nation for where TRI chemicals accumulate in any year between 1988 and 2014. This is a much improved measure of pollution, as it theoretically shows toxins experienced in any given location. The initial RSEI disaggregated microdata is approximately 4 terabytes of data. Given that the 800m grid across the United States has on the order of 10 billion squares, each release hits many squares, we have many releases, and the data covers 27 years, this is an enormous data set. The RSEI reformat of the TRI contains the following variables: X and Y are the geographic identifiers for the square on the grid across the US, with (0, 0) in the center of the US. Release number tells us which release that row is associated with. Chemical number through media are all release specific data. Conc (concentration) is specific to the release at that square, indicating the concentration of the chemical across that grid cell. ToxConc is the toxicity weighted concentration of that release in that grid cell. ‘Score’ variables are meant to be used as hazard created by that release in that grid cell, as they are weighted by the population in that grid cell. Below see an example of the disaggregated microdata: X Y Release Chem Facility Media Conc ToxConc Score -185 51 2050156 317 3 1 4.6e-4 2.28e-3 0 -184 41 2050156 317 3 1 3.3e-4 1.65e-3 0 -184 42 2050156 317 3 1 3.3e-4 1.67e-3 0 -184 43 2050156 317 3 1 3.3e-4 1.66e-3 0 -184 44 2050156 317 3 1 3.4e-4 1.68e-3 0 … … … … … … … … … 2.2 Important Caveats Due to the nature of the data, there are a few interesting caveats to consider. The RSEI data is self reported, and has been thought to contain some severe underreporting. (De Marchi and Hamilton, 2006) The data is entirely based off a black box fate and transport model. The model has uncertainty not being addressed. The data only captures releases for certain facility types within certain industries, for certain chemical types within those facilities. Not all chemicals are mandated reporting, and any analysis that is done based off the data can’t be extrapolated to discuss toxicity more generally. Not only does the data not capture all chemicals, it also doesn’t adress many common nuicances. Because of this, it is difficult to relate the RSEI scores to health or quality of life outcomes in an area. In discussion of environmental toxicity more generally, it is worth noting that certain toxicity types may be more or less likely to cause adverse effects based on how they reach people in the area (eg. they may or may not reach local water systems). There are also more obvious environmental hazards, that are likely to have strong influence on public health and living conditions that TRI doesn’t address, eg: brownfields, solid waste disposal, animal farming, hazardous waste, etc. RSEI gives the weight of the release and the chemical of the release, but chemicals have very different levels of toxicity. A small amount of mercury released is much more problematic than a small amount of CO2. To that end, the EPA assigned each chemical a ‘toxicity’ weight, by which the amount of the chemical released is multiplied. This means that we can aggregate all the chemicals in an area, and compare the overall toxicity over space and time. The toxicity weights allow us to compare to other chemicals’ toxicity weight, and overall toxicity of a given chemical release, but also means that the values only have meaning in comparison. Despite the limitations that the data presents, it provides an incredibly detailed and complex view of toxicity in America that is worth delving in to. 2.3 Consistency in Reporting (detailed data description) 2.3.1 Census Comparability For the time period that RSEI data is available for (1988 - 2014), Census geographies have experienced considerable overhaul. Many of our questions of interest involve demographic characteristics, and the changes we see in environmental toxicity over time for those demographics. As such, we need to be able to aggregate the toxicity to block group or tract level to be able to merge with Census data. To do so, we caluclate the toxicity values for each geographic unit in Census 2010 geography. Since we want to use Census areas as the unit of analysis, we create crosswalks that help us transform past Census data to the 2010 geographies. 2.3.2 Details of Chemical Consistency Comparability across time, space, and chemicals is a consistent topic through this section. Though the EPA is incredibly detailed in their data collection, they are also subject to the changing scientific consensus of the times, and therefore haven’t been able to provide entirely consistent data. Over time, as chemicals have been found to be toxic, they have been added to the list of TRI mandated reporting chemicals. There are also chemicals that through renewed understanding have been removed from the mandated reporting list. Because the list of chemicals reported changes over time, aggregating all the data would cause us to see artificial jumps in toxicity. These jumps wouldn’t be reflective of actual increases in toxicity, but rather that the toxicity was beginning to be measured. These jumps may change what areas appear toxic in the data, as industries that don’t have to report at some point in the time frame will be entirely removed from the dataset. Several of those industries are very highly polluting, locations that focus strongly on those industries will show inaccurate low scores. 2.3.3 Details of Industry Reporting Consistency TRI regulates who needs to self report using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and before NAICS was available used its predecessor, the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. Just as we see changes in the regulations for chemicals, we see changes in the regulations of various industries. NAICS codes that need to report are regulated independently of chemical codes, and NAICS codes that are not consistently reported across the time period of interest must be removed to maintain continuity. As an example, a textiles facility releasing mercury might have to report it, but the neighboring mining facility might not have to report their mercury emissions. If that changes over the time period, and suddenly mining needs to report, we will see an artificial huge jump in the mercury present in that area if we don’t remove by industry. 2.4 Ultimate Data Form The disaggregated microdata from RSEI is one observation per release per block on the 800m grid that it reached. We filter each of the billions of observations to check that it is 1) from a chemical that is consistent across the relevant years 2) from a release that is linked to an industry that is consistent across years, and then allocate the observation to the appropriate geographic unit. This data cleaning is done through R, using the DBI and SQLite packages. Since there is so much data, it’s not feasible to process it using typical R functions, so after loading the data in to a database, it becomes queryable using SQL. This significantly speeds up the processes detailed below. Filtering out observations whose releases are not under a regulated NAICS category for the entire time is more complex. Using a similar table that contains the regulation and deregulation dates of NAICS codes we can find the consistent industry categories. However, the only reference to NAICS or SIC codes are in the facility table that the releases reference. This table provides 6 NAICS codes that are the most common NAICS codes associated with the facility. However, NAICS codes are release specific, not facility specific, meaning that for each emission reported a NAICS code is reported. Removing by facility is not accurate, since facilities have different types of NAICS emissions. The textiles facility we used as an example earlier might make both shoes and jackets, with different industry codes and different releases that have different reporting requirements. To get data on the NAICS codes by submission, data must be taken from the original TRI data, and linked to the disaggregated microdata by the document control number. In the data cleansing process, we filter the data to remove industries and chemicals that were not consistent over the period of inquiry, and aggregate the data to the relevant Census geographies. The data, then forms a data set for each year, with an observation for each block group, and just one measure, an aggregated toxicity level. block concentration area 010010201001 627.3050138 6.520168 010010201002 499.6297799 8.48669 010010202001 578.8311689 3.137173 010010202002 756.3733114 1.962949 010010203001 637.7356488 5.907125 … … … The ‘concentration’ estimate must be interpreted in the context of the consistency adjustments. The pollution estimates are comparable across time and location, but only in the context of continuous EPA regulation, and can not be interpreted independently of one another. "],
["3-ref-labels.html", "Chapter 3 Approaches and Methods 3.1 Geographic Level of Analysis 3.2 Temporal Level of Analysis 3.3 Simulation", " Chapter 3 Approaches and Methods 3.1 Geographic Level of Analysis The questions we would like to pose - how the distributions of toxicity that individuals experience over time are predicted by their complex, multidimensional identities - is inherently intended to be a person level analysis. Until now environemental justice work has used census geographies or point sources as the unit of analysis. This analysis depends on two data sources, the disaggregated RSEI toxic release data (as compiled to contain only releases that are consistently reported between 1990 and 2010) as well as relevant demographic information from the Census. RSEI toxicity data can be obtained at extremely fine level (the 800 meter grid across the United States,) but the finest grain Census data is available at is the block level, which contains between 0 and a thousand people. At such low geographic levels, cross tabs aren’t available for demographics due to identifiability concerns. Using a low level of geography (like census blocks or block groups) is important for the environmental aspect of this analysis, since environmental hazards can be very localized, especially along neighborhood lines in urban areas. Unfortunately, the availability of cross tabulations is equally important to the goal of this work in examining inequality of environmental burden held by minority groups in America. The intersection of social identies, especially those steeped in systems of oppression, is extremely important for identifying unequal burdens. For example, low income populations across the board may be more likely to experience environmental hazards, but low income minority populations may be much more likely than low income white populations to experience extreme hazard. The intersections of demographic charictersitics, such as race and income or race and education are likely to be important in teasing out differences true inequality burden. We combine the computed aggregated toxicity for each block group and the demographic data. Now for each census geography, we have toxicity information as well as demographic data. block concentration area total_pop white black 010010201001 627.3050 6.520168 530 447 83 010010201002 499.6298 8.486690 1282 1099 126 010010202001 578.8312 3.137173 1274 363 824 010010202002 756.3733 1.962949 944 458 477 010010203001 637.7356 5.907125 2538 2152 384 … … … … … … To move to a person level analysis, we assign each person the toxicity for the geography they originated in. By assigning each person the toxicity of their block group, we can aggregate nationally to find the distribution of toxicity that each social group experiences. This approach is restricted by Census data availability, since we can only build a distribution for each of the crosstabs we have available. For higher levels of geography (where we might, for example, have race by income) we would be able to build national distributions for each income by race group. In the case of the table above, to build a distribution for the white population, we would assign 447 people a toxicity of ~627, 1099 people a toxicity of ~499 and so on until we have the full distribution of toxicities experienced by the white population. In choosing the level of aggregation at which to assign toxicity, in order to balance the needs of accuracy of toxicity and availability of cross tabulations, we create the overall toxicity distribution for Americans at each of the levels of geography. The process described above can be excecuted with the data shown above, or at a cruder level of geography, such as state or region. Using block group as the smallest form of geography, and state as the largest we build toxicity distributions at each level of aggregation. As expected, the state level assignment is a poor approximation of the lower level assignments. Given that we are assigning each individual the mean toxicity in their entire state, we are eliminating most of the variation from the data. Interestingly tract and county data seems to build a distribution quite similar to the block group level assignment. Initial results were replicated using all 3 levels of assignment, and conclusions remained the same. This may be because the block group level is aggregating a large enough group of our fine grain toxicity data that it lost the street block by street block variation that we had deemed so crucial, meaning aggregating several block groups gives us a conceptual equivalent ‘neighborhood’ level of aggregation. The ecological fallacy is a consistent discussion in environmental justice literature. It is speculated to be the reason for varying results, as toxicity data can be sensitive to geographic level of analysis, time of collection, and area. In this case, conclusions appear robust to unit of assignments. 3.2 Temporal Level of Analysis Given the layout of this non-parametric method, we can find the changes in positional distribution for any two given years. Though we are most interested in the complete change from the starting year of 1988 to 2014, the gradual changes and the speed of change from year to year is also of interest. While we have the full range of data from 1988 to 2014 for the toxicity data, we only have available Census data from the decennial census and the ACS. That means that we have snapshots of data from 1990, 2000, and continuous data for 2010 on. In order to do a continuous analysis from 1990 until the most recent toxicity data, we chose to use linear interpolation between the decenial census. For 2010 through 2013 data, we use the 5 year ACS sample. 3.3 Simulation To examine the differing changes in environmental burden over time for minority groups we first use simulation to tease apart the forces in play as each group’s distribution changes over time. For any given value, the percentile it holds in a minority distribution is likely to be different from the percentile it holds in the overall distribution. For example, in 2010 the 75th percentile of the black distribution is 2528.45, while that same value is the 81.44th percentile in the overall distribution. We expect the mean of minority distributions to reduce over time for two reasons: the entire distribution is slowly shifting right as we see improvements in environmentally friendly production technology and more comprehensive envirnmental regulation; secondly, we hope that with Title VI protetections, and the work of civil rights advocates, minority communities will be better equipped to mobilize against polluters. In order to track how minority distribution and the overall distribution have changed over the period of study, we use the positions that minority individuals held in the overall distribution at the start of the period of study to simulate how each group’s distribution would have progressed through time assuming a static position in society at large. This simulation procedure was first discussed by Bayer, Patrick and Kerwin as a method of identifying the true gains in ‘Black-White Earning Differences’ (2016). The method decomposes observed gains in to two distinct types, distributional convergance, where differences are reduced due to compression of the overall distribution, and positional convergance, where differences are reduced due to changes in the relative means of the distributions. This simulation proceeds as follows: Build an emipirical distribution of toxicity experienced for the entire population and for groups of interest in the starting year. Sample individuals from the empirical distributions of the groups of interest. For each sampled toxicity value, find the percentile it holds in the empirical distribution for the entire population in the starting year. Create an empirical distribution for the entire population in the ending year. For each sampled percentile, find the corresponding toxicity value in the full empirical distribution of the ending year and compile results to create a simulated group of interest. Using this method we can hold constant the place each individual (and more broadly each group) holds in the overall distribution, but follow the changes in the distribution as a whole. The collection of values simulated now represents where each individual or group would have been if they had held the same relative position in the overall toxicity distribution, meaning there had been no positional improvement for the group as a whole. If there had been positional improvement for a group, we would expect the simulated distributions to paint a bleaker picture of the environmental burden borne than the true distribution of the ending year. 3.3.1 Simulation Accuracy We use bootstrap sampling to approximate the standard errors of the simulated estimates of the 5th, 50th and 95th quantiles with different sampling sizes. This is done by simulating the new distribution at time t repeatedly with varying n, and describing the distribution of quantiles produced. This sampling helps us to choose a size of the sample to get an accurate measure, and frames the final values we report. For the 5th quantile, a relatively low n produces a fairly stable result, sampling with n = 15,000 appears sufficient. Due to the extreme right skew of the data, the 95th percentile requires a larger sample. Still n = 50,000 is sufficient. "],
["4-trends.html", "Chapter 4 General Trends 4.1 Toxicity Trends 4.2 Geography of Toxicity Trends", " Chapter 4 General Trends 4.1 Toxicity Trends Spurred by fear created by a disaster release of toxic chemicals in India, the Community Right to Know Act was created in 1986 to enforce reporting on hazardous chemicals being realeased in to the environment by individual facilities. TRI data, beginning in 1988, is the public release of the data created through the Community Right to Know Act. The time after TRI began collection included a lot of environmental regulation, including the Montreal Protol, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the 1994 Executive Order directing ‘federal agiencies to identify and address the disproportionately high … environmental effects … on minority populations.’ (Executive Order, 1994) As more and more environmental protections went in to place and collective environmental attitudes became greener, we expect to see large drops in toxicity experienced by all groups. The early 1990’s enforced mandated phase outs of certain CFC’s and requirements for facilities to switch to Best Available Control Technology (BACT), so there should be large drops in toxicity. Looking at the net volume of TRI releases, we do see a fairly linear drop in the pounds of TRI chemicals being released nationally between 1988 and 2013. Despite the common use of volume of TRI releases as a study measure (SOURCES) the rest of this work proceeds to use TRI toxicity as the measure of interest. TRI toxicity refers to the weight of each release multiplied by the toxicity weight assigned to the chemical by the EPA. Given that TRI chemicals vary significantly in their potential human effects, toxicity experienced is a better measure of the potential human impact than the net weight of toxic chemicals experienced. Given that this seeks to find differences in pollution experienced by minority groups, toxicicty is even more important, as there is potential that more toxic releases are focused in minority communities, which would not be evident by net weight. Toxicity trends look very different than the net release trends shown above. This is partially attributable to the strongly skewed distribution of toxicity. As some releases are of extremely toxic chemicals, the distribution of toxicities experienced is extremely right skewed by toxic dumps. Given the extremely right skewed nature of this distribution, for ease of analysis and interpretation, from here on toxicity is reported as log toxicity. The distributions of log toxicity are much more interpretable, but care must be used to contextualize the results. In this application, there are locations that are orders of magnitude more toxic than the bulk of the United States. These are sites to be aware of, where toxicity is more likely to have an effect on people’s lives or health. As discussed in the data section, toxicity measures don’t necessarily align with the locations that we know are truly hazardous. Many of the locations that arise as especially toxic in the data are assuredly so. High Point, NC is consistently one of the most toxic tracts in the early 2000’s, as confirmed by EPA reports identifying it as a location prime for testing toxicity abatement measures. Tracts outside of Salt Lake City commonly known for acting as dumping grounds are consistently ranked as toxic in the early 2000’s. Mobile, AL, whose 3 superfund sites were proposed in the early 1990’s, routinely ranks as toxic over that time period. On the other side of the coin, there are many known toxic events and locations that fail to ever reach the top 5% of toxic tracts, of which Flint, MI, and the Houston major superfund site are good examples. 4.2 Geography of Toxicity Trends Toxic exposure has been changing dramatically in the US, but the trends it follows have remained similar. In the gif below, we show toxicity across the US from 2010 to 2014. GIF of toxicity in America from 2010 to 2014. Though we see impressive reductions over that time, the overall geographic trends of toxicity remain constant. Each region maintains its overall toxicity range, and toxicity wells appear to stay constant. Given the infrastructure required to build up manufacturing, a large part of TRI, the consistency across time is reasonable. The toxicity wells we see in the image are familiar, as many of them occur around large cities, where there is likely to be industry. Though many large cities stand out as having high toxicity, there’s not a one to one correlation between areas of high toxicity and population density. As an example, in Texas, Houston and San Antonio have high toxicity values, while the Dallas/Fort has fairly low toxictiy. Comparatively, the more rural areas of Longview and Tyler are very high toxicity. Regions that stand out the most include the northern border of Kentucky, the regions surrounding Chicago, the border between New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and the westernmost section of the gulf coast. A closer view of the Texan region of the gulf coast is shown below. GIF of toxicity in America from 2010 to 2014. Over the 1990-2013 period, we see an incredible reduction of toxicity in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, going from an area with a large center of extremely high toxicity, to mid range toxicity. Much of this improvement happens before 2000, where we see the area of 15,000+ toxicity drastically reduce in size. Despite a large overall reduction, the areas with the most sustained high toxicity are Houston, Longview and Beaumont. Some larger citites, like San Antonio, Austin and El Paso show much lower toxicity levels by 2013. "],
["5-organization.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Trends in Minority Toxicity Burden 5.2 Simulating Changes 5.3 Interacting Risk Cases 5.4 Quantile Regression", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Trends in Minority Toxicity Burden Using data at the tract level, we assign the tract concentration to the counts of each group in the tract. By assigning toxicity for each tract, we build four distributions: toxicity for the white population, toxicity for the black population, toxicity for the hispanic population, and toxicity for all other groups. In this case, hispanic is not a mutually exclusive group, and the race groups may contain ethnically hispanic individuals. For each of the distributions, the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles are calculated for each time period. In the case of toxicity, the 5th and 95th percentiles are especially of interest, as they represent the non-polluted neighborhoods that each group has access to and the level of pollution trap that each group falls in to. Clearly, for all variables, lower toxicity is better. Plots describing the trends for each quantile are shown below. On the left is the log toxicity for the quantile over time. On the right is the toxicity minorities experience relative to the white distribution. These values are computed as the net toxicity of the given quantile for a group divided by the net toxicity of the quantile for the white distribution. As we see in the 5th percentile plots, the 5th percentile of experienced toxicity is steadily decreasing for all groups. Given the y axis has been logged, and we see a linear trend, toxicity has seen an exponential drop over the years. There appear to be two distinct groups, with the black and ‘other’ groups significantly higher than the white and hispanic groups in 1988, and even moredistinctly seperated by 2013. Though we see incredible improvements in toxicity for all groups, the relative improvement shows a different story. The difference for the ‘other’ minorities is most impressive, originally having 5th percentile toxicity at approximately 1.5 times the rate of the white 5th percentile, but ending at over 6 times the white 5th percentile. From this plot we see that though minorities have had the largest net decreases in 5th percentile toxicity, those gains are an artifact of how much higher their toxicity began at. When framing improvements relative to the white population, there has been no improvement, in some cases relative toxicity has regressed. The toxicity changes for the 50th percentile tell a very different story. Again, we see linear improvement in the logged toxicity plot, indicating an exponential decrease in the toxicity experienced by the 50th percentile of the population. The difference at the 50th percentile is that minority groups have improved faster than their white counterparts, meaning that the relative toxicity of all groups is converging towards the 50th percentile of the white distribution. Ninety-fifth percentile toxicity is in some ways the most of interest. The difference between estimates for white and minorities is approximately an order of magnitude at the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile, but at this level an order of magnitude is a much larger difference than in the 5th percentile. An interesting difference is that at the high end of the distribution, we see the ‘other’ minority group has a relative toxicity close to 1, where in previous plots the other group had significantly worse relative toxicity. Similarly, though the hispanic group previously performed closest to the white group, at the 95th percentile the hispanic group performs more similarly to the black distribution. Examining the changes in each of these plots independently gives us a glimpse at how the distributions as a whole are shifting. The lack of change, or even worsening, of relative toxicity for the black and other distributions at the 5th percentile may be indicative of barriers minorities face in access to clean communities. As wealthier communities are getting ever cleaner, minorities are still unable to gain access to them, meaning less improvement in the low tail of the minority distributions. Comparatively, the changes at the 50th percentile show that minorities have all consistently improved faster than the white 50th percentile, meaning that the bulk of the distribution has been shifting faster than the white distribution. In the 95th percentile, we see the hispanic group performing similarly to the white distribution, while the black and hispanic distributions improve until the early 2000’s, and then flatten out or rise relative to the white distribution. With the widening gap in the 5th percentile, the closing gap in the 50th percentile, and the stagnation of change in the 95th, we see that the distribution is shifting left and condensing as the left tail stagnates, and the right tail slowly moves in. In essense we are seeing the “rich getting richer” phenomenon in the 5th percentile of the white distribution. Those that already have access to clean communities are seeing improved toxicity, with those who weren’t already in clean communities unable to catch up, and locked out of the lowest toxicity communities. 5.2 Simulating Changes Being able to build the true distributions that each group experiences over time allows us to see how relative toxicity burden has changed over time. Yet the changes presented in the analysis above are solely the net changes experienced by each group. Given minorities are more likely to be in the right tail of the distribution, any compression of that tail would result in both a net improvement for minority groups and a relative improvement to the white distribution. Those changes, though positive, don’t represent a true change in the position minorities hold in the distribution, as they are still stuck in the percentile of the distribution, but the distribution has shifted favorably. To find how much of the change is attributable to changes of minority position, we use the simulation method discussed in section 3. By holding the percentile of each individual constant, but applying it to the new distribution, we can see what the minority distribution would like if the minority position within the overall distribution had not changed. Improvement will only represent true environmental justice when all groups are equally likely to be represented at any given quantile, not when the distribution is compressed enough that differences are negligible. The 5th percentile of the simulated black distribution is significantly higher than that of the true black distribution, rising to approximately 12 times that of the white distribution. This means that more black individuals were able to move to locations with lower toxicity or had dramatic improvements in neighborhood toxicity. If they had maintained their location in the overall distribution, they would have experienced significantly higher toxicities. Interestingly, the opposite is true for the ‘other’ distribution. Their true 5th percentile has significantly worse toxicity than their simulated 5th percentile. This indicates that non-black minorities at the low end of the distribution have worse places in the overall distribution than they did in 1990. Changes at the 50th percentile were much more impressive in the initial analysis, and remain that way. The simulated distributions still show improvement, but very minor compared to the observed improvement. The simulated black 50th percentile drops from 3 times to 2.75 times the white 50th percentile, where the true distribution drops from 3 times to 1.5 times the white distribution. All the simulations show the same pattern, with the hispanic group showing the largest difference between true and simulated 50th percentile, the simulated group ending at 2.25 times the white distribution, and the true group ending at 0.75 times the white distribution. Interpreting these changes as the portion of change attributable to true change in where each group stands in the distribution, it seems that there has been significant change in the positions minorities hold in the overall toxicity distribution. Simulations of the 95th percentile show even less improvement, meaning nearly all the change minorities experience is from moving towards a lower quantile in the overall distribution. At the 95th percentile the black distribution shows the largest difference to it’s simulated distribution. The simulated black 95th percentile ends at 2.25 times that of the white distribution, while the 95th percentile of the true distribution ends at 1.75 times that of the white distribution. From this we see that the distribution of quantiles occupied by minority groups was originally shifted towards the higher quantiles, but over time have shifted right. Plotting the percentiles of each group within their full distribution that year, we see that in 1990 all minority groups are strongly skewed towards the higher end of the distribution. As time goes on, more minorities exist in the lower percentiles, and more whites exist in the higher percentiles of the distribution. 5.3 Interacting Risk Cases 5.4 Quantile Regression Previous sections have focused on teasing apart patterns in the vast amounts of data we have, attempting to find differences in toxicity experienced by minority groups. We find large differences in the toxicity experienced, but may be limited by the choices in division we make. Given we only investigate the variables that we suspect may have a relationship with toxicity, there are likley patterns in teh data that aren’t being examined. In order to better tease out relationships in the data, and for easy interpretation of coefficients, a functionally similar analysis can be done with quantile regression, focusing on the computed parameters as indicators of the differences in experienced toxicity. To illustrate the form of model this could take, we build preliminary quantile regression models on the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of the toxicity distribution. To predict log toxicity, we use the year, demographic information, population density as well as quadratic terms. The predictions shown for each race or ethnicity group are fairly consistent with the results shown above. By adding additional block level data to this regression and testing model fit more rigorously, we may be able to discuss the magnitude of toxicity differences that are attributable to race, and will be more informed on the other factors that hold importance in predicting toxicity. Above sections address the empirical reduction in toxicity and the reduction amount attributable to shifts of minority placement in the distribution. An approach able to take it a step further and find the differences attributable to race would add significant value. "],

Social Science Research, 53, pp. 375-390. Uses data from 1995 to 2004, sourcing toxicity data from RSEI and racial data from the GeoLytics releases of the 1990 and 2000 Census’, interpolating through 2004. Measures experienced toxicity as the weight of total toxic releases in a block group. Aims to close the gap in how air pollution exposure “has varied by policy implementation boundaries”. Approaches modeling through the lens of alternating geographies in an attempt to answer that question, using EPA regions, states, MSAs and counties. Models the log pollution experienced in block group i in geographic unit j at time t using the overall mean, location, and time data to predict. Uses multi-level models to take in to account the correlated structure of observations Finds that African Americans have the most dramatic changes to exposure. (Slope of ~-60), but are still more exposed than whites. Relative toxicity does not appear to decrease. Suggests that future work should use variance component models to “show that the most variance in pollution exposure can be explained at the county level”. Also suggests further work on the protective aspects of income by race, and suggest a trend the literature towards isolating causal mechanisms. Looking at income, they find that income is less protective for minorities, ie high income black people were more exposed than high income white people. Ash, Michael, et al. “Is environmental justice good for white folks? Industrial air toxics exposure in Urban America.” Social Science Quarterly 94.3 (2013): 616-636. Uses RSEI data to look at toxic air exposure in urban areas. Finds that exposure is correlated with minority presence. Finds that in areas with high minority pollution burden there is a higher average pollution experienced by all groups. Aka in high toxicity areas there is more inequality. Given that disparity areas are generally high toxicity, environmental justice movements could also benefit white people. Ash, Michael, and T.

Defines ‘positional rank’ as the percentile the median black man would hold in the white distribution. Introduces a decomposition method to show the gains of black men over time, and address how much of that is due to distributional convergence (ie changes in the overall distribution of incomes) rather than positional convergence. Finds that below the median, there has been strong racial convergence, likely due to improved access to education. Been, Vicki, and Francis Gupta. “Coming to the nuisance or going to the barrios?

Addresses only the 26 superfund sites in SC, focuses on the disparities in spatial distribution. (Similar to Fisher) Uses the 2000 Census data at both tract and block level for population data, as well as data on Superfund locations.

Crowder, Kyle, and Liam Downey. “Interneighborhood migration, race, and environmental hazards: Modeling microlevel processes of environmental inequality.” American Journal of Sociology 115.4 (2010): 1110-1149. Uses individual level data and neighborhood level industrial hazard data. Individual data is sourced from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which follows families across decades and records household characteristics. Points out the lack of multilevel data on mobility at an individual level. This is the focus since it helps to address the question of environmental inequality origins, and if they result from disproportionate migration. Uses point data for toxicity estimates, and weights the point level toxicity observations by distance to individual to create individual level toxicity estimates. Discusses discrimination in housing at a national level, and trends in individual opinions on neighborhood sorting. Finds large difference in the toxicity experienced by black individuals. Higher incomes are associated with lower toxicity in the destinations of individuals, especially for black and hispanic individuals, who only appear to move to lower toxicity areas when they have especially high incomes. De Marchi, Scott, and James T. Hamilton. “Assessing the accuracy of self-reported data: an evaluation of the toxics release inventory.” Journal of Risk and uncertainty 32.1 (2006): 57-76. Compares air emissions as reported in the TRI data to measurements compiled from pollution monitors the EPA has. Finds that drips in emissions as recorded in TRI is not always linearly matched by drops in true measures. Additionally, reported TRI data is found to not follow Benford’s Law, which states that the leading digit’s of naturally occuring data should follow a defined distribution. Given TRI data doesn’t follow Benford’s law, it is likely that the reports aren’t accurate estimates. Downey, Liam. “US metropolitan-area variation in environmental inequality outcomes.” Urban Studies 44.5-6 (2007): 953-977. Addresses the fact that environmental studies have a large distribution of findings, ranging from strong evidence for disparate burden to no evidence of racial inequality. Theorizes that it may be because some areas show disparate while others don’t, meaning that in aggregate the truth may be hard to tease apart. Finds that inequality varies over the examined metropolitan areas. Finds that neither income inequality nor segregation can explain the variation of inequality across cities. Fisher J. B., Kelly M. &amp; Romm J. (2006). Scales of environmental justice: Combining GIS and spatial analysis for air toxics in West Oakland, California. Health &amp; Place, 12, pp. 701-714. Uses data from the ISCST3 air dispersion model, and local knowledge of non-point soureces of diesel emissions in West Oakland. Does a disparate impact analysis based on the EPA’s requirements to classify an area as disproportionately impacted. Proves that the point sources are not randomly dispersed accros the Bay area, let alone the Oakland area, and shows statistically significant clusters of facilities. Relatively unique in the literature due to its discussion of non point source pollution, specifically using map data to evaulate high traffic areas and major shipping routes. Gilbert A. &amp; Chakraborty, J. (2011). Using geographically weighted regression for environmental justice analysis: Cumulative cancer risks from air toxics in Florida. Social Science Research, 40, pp. 273-286. Created on a tract level analysis, using data on air pollutants in Florida, Census 2000 data, and data on cancer risk. Toxic data used is the EPA National-Scale Air Toxics Assesment in 1999, used because they think that the point source estimates usually implemented are limiting, and because NATA also provides estimation of cancer risk. Statistical methodology based up geographically weighted regression, as an attempt to address the traditional regression techniques currently being used in the literature. Finds that race is related to the experienced cancer risk of individuals. Hunter, Lori M., et al. “Environmental hazards, migration, and race.” Population &amp; Environment 25.1 (2003): 23-39. Uses census data on county level outmigration as it relates to the presence of environmental hazards. Addresses outmigration as one of the potential sources of environmental inequality. If it were a source, we would expect to see minorities moving to more hazardous areas, and white families fleeing the hazardous areas. When accounting for socioeconomic factors, labor force opportunities and climate, no difference is found in outmigration between social groups. Results may not be positive due to level of analysis. Finer grain or individual level may give different results. Kravitz-Wirtz N., Crowder K., Hajat A. &amp; Sass V. (2016). The Long-term Dynamics of Racial/Ethnic Inequality in Neighborhood Air Pollution Exposure, 1990-2009. Du Bois Review, 13(2), pp. 237-259. Uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), and data on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) from the Toxic Resource Inventory (TRI) and the Air Quality System (AQS). Find that “Blacks and Latinos are, on average, more likely to be exposed to higher levels of NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 than Whites.” More specifically, examines the “correspondence between neighborhood racial composition and pollution levels” using the household level data in PSID. Additionally uses measures of population density and residential segregation (measured using multigroup entropy index) of the areas each of the households are located in. Uses a multilevel repeated measures model. Level 1 is individual intercepts and slopes, Level 2 is the average of all intercepts and slopes, with coefficients for race and time, Level 3 accounts for metropolitan areas. Conclusions: There are substantial racial differneces in exposure to several kinds pollution. This persists even for households in similar circumstances. Declines in pollution over time have gone predominantly to minority groups. Future work: Disentangle if differences come from “racially distinct patterns of individual mobility”, “neighborhood change”, or industrial siting. Moghadam A. K. &amp; Kayahan B. (2017). What influences the pattern of pollutant releases? An investigation of firms’ siting and households’ sorting decisions in Ontario, Canada. Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, 60(4). pp. 743-754. Discusses the issue of how siting decisions are made by polluting firms. Compares that idea to the neighborhood sorting concept. Used data from the 1996, 2001, and 2006 Canadian Census’ (I think the only one not American data) as well as the National Pollutant Release Inventory. Defined neighborhoods as affected if there was a facility within one mile radius of the borders. Used neighborhood characteristics in a binomial regression to predict presence or absence of a facility. Found that clean neighborhoods were negatively correlated with % immigrants. O’Neil, Sandra George. “Superfund: evaluating the impact of executive order 12898.” Environmental Health Perspectives 115.7 (2007): 1087. Superfunds are sites that have been designated by the EPA as areas of “significant threat to both surrounding populations and the environment” and are given priority for federal cleanup funds. While minority communities experience a large portion of the toxicity, they are underrepresented in the superfund site list, meaning they aren’t recieving an appropriate benefit from the fund. Executive Order 12898 (by President Clinton) required that the EPA (and other agencies) have environmental justice policies that “address environmental effects on minority and low-income populations.” Finds that EO 12898 has been ineffective at improving the representation of minority communities in the Superfund program. In fact, finds that since the order minorities are even less likely to be included on the list. Order, Executive. “Federal actions to address environmental justice in minority populations and low-income populations: executive order 12898.” Federal Register 59.32 (1994): 7629-7633. Requires that each federal agency “make acheiving environmental justice part of its mission”. Created an interagency working group devoted to environmental justice. Pais J., Crowder K. &amp; Downey L. (2013). Unequal Trajectories: Racial and Class Differences in Residential Exposure to Industrial Hazard. Social Forces, 92(3). pp. 1189-1215 Focuses on differences via different residential sorting and toxic facility siting. Statistical methodology used is a latent class growth analysis. Data used is longitudinal xyz and neighborhood level pollution. Found large difference in pollution exposure by race. Also found that minorities were more likely to experience persistance in being highly exposed. Examined how that finding relates to having access to the suburbs, and found that even controlling for suburban attainment, economic status, and ability to move, there was still a racial difference. Ringquist, Evan J. “Equity and the distribution of environmental risk: The case of TRI facilities.” Social science quarterly (1997): 811-829. Looks at point sources in TRI data to examine if facilities are concentrated in minority communities. Uses TRI data along with probit models against TRI facilities in ZIP codes. Finds that even with other socioeconomic and zip code factors, TRI facilities are more likely to be placed in zip codes with high minority populations. Shows that racial minorities are more likely to live near environmental risk. Sadd, James L., et al. “”Every breath you take…“: the demographics of toxic air releases in Southern California.” Economic Development Quarterly 13.2 (1999): 107-123. Techniques used include GIS mapping, logit, ordered logit, and tobit regression. Find that while controlling for factors that are likely to be relevant to toxicity, such as manufacturing employment, minorities are more likely to be in neighborhoods with high toxicity. Szasz, A., &amp; Meuser, M. (1997). Environmental inequalities: Literature review and proposals for new directions in research and theory. Current sociology, 45(3), 99-120. Environmental justice work brought the “tactics and rhetoric of the Civil Rights movement to bear on an environmental issue” 3 papers created the canon: The US GAO examination of demographics near four large hazardous waste sites, The United Church of Christ’s study on demographics in zip codes that had or didn’t have hazardous waste treatment sites, and a study finding that 21 out of 25 of solid waste facilites in Houston were in predominantly black neighborhoods. Data has been trying to ground race as the main inequality of interest, as opposed to the common focus on class. Mixed results in environmental justice can be due to several things, one being the ecological fallacy, or another being that injustices aren’t equal across areas. It may be that local studies are more successful due to the local nature/histories of locations. So far work has focused mostly on showing that inequities exist. These data driven questions, with tangible answers, have driven the field, but have created room for more qualitative work focusing on the histories that led to these inequalities. Additional neglected topics in the field include: a larger historical framework, as current data has been both temporally and regionally limited. A larger global framework, since nearly all work has been focused on America. An investigation of the location of the wealthy, as examining the flip side of the coin may provide as much information about comparative trends for the poor. The field as a whole needs to address the larger implications of environmental justice, recontextualizing it as a small (yet fundamental) part of the social inequalities that have defined America’s history.
