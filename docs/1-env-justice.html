<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Environmental Justice Theories</h2>
<p>The growing body of environmental literature has shown with increasing certainty that minorities in America experience a higher poullution level on average than the white population. The literature has focused primarily on air pollution and industrial facilities releases, the two areas with the most consistently accessible data. Many authors have focused on point source pollution, measuring individual pollution as a binary: the presence or absence of a polluting facility in the geographic level of analysis (SOURCE). An alternate measure of pollution exposure has been the count of polluting facilities within various buffer zones. These measures, limited by available data, fail to account for the variance in what chemicals, and how much of them, facilities emit. Alternate approaches include data on transportation emissions, and broader environmental data, like levels of NO2 and PM2.5.</p>
<p>Environmental justice literature results are not all in agreement. Many studies conclude that minorities do experience a disproportionate toxicity or pollution burden (SOURCES), others find that economic class accounts for most of the difference in experienced toxicity (SOURCES), yet others find no racial differences (Anderson).</p>
<p>Environmental justice research is unique in that research and advocacy have gone hand in hand, leading to questions guided by the needs of communities. This trend has led to unusually focused work, evaluating specific communities for the presence of specfic toxins at specific times (SOURCE). Though some work has had a broader net, few authors have broached national data (SOURCES) and even fewer have used data spanning significant time (SOURCES). Due to the definitions of pollution being used, uncertainty in accessible pollution data, and differing geographic units of analysis, work spanning broader time periods as well as a wider geographic range is neccessary to try to understand processes operating on a national scale that lead to environmental inequality.</p>
<p>Despite differing conclusions from the collective body of research, how we define and think about environmental justice is evolving. Alongside descriptive studies that investigate specific pollution trends, theories of how environmental injustices are created have arisen. The main theorized explanations for environmental injustice are economic, sociopolitical and discriminatory explanations.</p>
<div id="economic-explanations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Economic Explanations</h3>
<p>Theories focusing on economic explanations for environmental inequality rely on individual rational choice as an explanation. Especially in the case of point source pollution, companies must make economically rational decisions when siting facilities. Those decisions can be multifaceted: if the location has easy access to transportation, or is close to raw materials, but a primary concern is cost of land. Given companies want cheap land for polluting facilities, and minority communities tend to be near cheap land (SOURCE), it’s rational that there would be more facility siting in minority areas.</p>
<p>In the same vein, it would be economically rational for those with the means to escape newly sited pollution to do so (SOURCE). Under this theory, cheaper land is more likely to be near minority communities, facilities will be sited there, and those who can afford to escape do so, devaluing the land further, and making it all the more attractive for facility siting. Despite the direct cause and effect theorized, results have been mixed. Several studies found that more facilities were sited in minority communities (SOURCES), while others didn’t (SOURCES).</p>
<ul>
<li>low income is not a protected class, so there is no legal recourse to this.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="sociopolitical-explanations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Sociopolitical Explanations</h3>
<p>An alternate explanation still relies upon siting decisions, but is more explicitly exploitative. Sociopolitical explanations theorize that companies rationaly chose to site in minority communities, as they will provide less resistance. At risk communities would show a lower voter turnout, have a large older population, may be disproportionately renters, and may be poorly politically represented. In theory, communities with lower organizing potential are more attractive for facility siting, as they pose a low risk of creating political or economic resistence to the proposed facility.</p>
</div>
<div id="racial-discrimination" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Racial Discrimination</h3>
<p>Racial discrimination theories are divided in to overt and insitutional racism theories. In discussion of these theories the language used tends to change, using the term ‘environmental racism’ rather than ‘environmental justice’.</p>
<p>The overt discrimination theory speculates on the intentions of the individuals making the final siting decisions. In this case, overt racism refers to the siting decisions as choices made intentionally to cause strife to minority communities or protect wealthy white communities.</p>
<p>The intstitutional discrimination theory relies primarily on housing dynamics. Based on the knowledge that the number of minority individuals living near a sited facility has risen since first measured (SOURCE), the theory states that minorities move towards polluting facilities due to reduced choice in the housing market. Reduced choice can arise in several ways: the choices realtors make in showing homes or the availability of mortgages or loans. Local governments can compound the problems with housing, as minority areas are more likely to be rezoned for industrial purposes by local government (SOURCE).</p>
<p>These three theories all boil down to the same outcome. Despite using different language and justifications all represent different forms of instutional discrimination. Economic explanations rely on the segregation of minority communites created by redlining. Redlining destroyed investment in communities, prevented black families from investing in homes, and enforced segregated communities. Redlining created the geography and culture that enables economic and sociopolitical explanation, making it a consequence of previous overt discrimination.</p>
<p>Though the current theories of siting choices would all create the same behaviour, the different reasonings can help to explain (and perhaps change) the trends that lead to environmental injustice.</p>

<ul>
<li>address the first question of ej literature by (with this new+improved data, over a longer period of time than analyzed in any of the literature) by looking at how the groups differ, and how that changes over time. -improve by using accurate measures of location (not people within range of TRI, not amount of pollution, but the toxicity of the pollution experienced by ppl)</li>
<li>what is the relative toxicity experienced by minority groups over this time period</li>
<li>how protective are finances?</li>
