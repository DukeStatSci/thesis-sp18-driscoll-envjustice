<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Environmental justice studies have been significantly limited by data availability, focusing on neighborhood level studies and working hand in hand with organizers to study toxicity disparity patterns within communities. As an injustice inherent to the societal structure of our nation, environmental justice questions should be addressed at a national scale. The Risk Screening Environmental Indicator model (RSEI) data was released for public use in 2015, allowing work with fine-grained toxicity data available nationally since 1988.</p>
<p>RSEI data is fine-grained dataset, reporting toxicity on an 800m by 800m grid across the US. However RSEI contains many inconsistencies over time, and needs to be aggregated to the census geography. By aggregating RSEI data, we are able to calculate toxicity measures for each block group. In combination with the census data, this allows us to estimate distributions of toxicity experienced by minority groups in the United States. Additionally, we are able to analyze macro level trends over time, such as the overall geography of toxicity in the United States, how the 5<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>, and 95<sup>th</sup> percentiles of toxicity experienced by each race group varies over time, and how income brackets relate to toxicity experienced for each race group.</p>
<p>Results show that toxicity is decreasing dramatically for all and, though the gap is closing, there still remains a large difference in toxicity experienced between white and minority groups. Additionally, the effects of income on experienced toxicity are unclear, and may need additional data to untangle.</p>
<p>In order to make results accessible, they are incorporated into a publicly available app that allows users to investigate toxicity in their area relative to the U.S. at large, and investigate the differences in local race-related toxicity burden. Additionally, a package containing functions to help convert RSEI dissaggregated microdata to a consistent form was created to help make the work reproducible and encourage work on similar questions.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Theoretical Background</h1>
<p>The growing body of environmental literature strives to investigate how minorities differently experience pollution as compared to the white population. The literature has focused primarily on air pollution and industrial facilities releases in America, the areas with the most consistently accessible data. Many authors have focused on point source pollution, measuring how individuals experience pollution as a binary: the presence or absence of a polluting facility in the geographic unit of analysis (Szasz and Meuser, 1997). An alternate measure of pollution exposure is the count of polluting facilities within increasingly large buffer zones. These measures, limited by available data, fail to account for the variance in what chemicals, and how much of them, facilities emit. Alternate approaches have included data on transportation emissions and levels of NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> measured by air quality monitors.</p>
<p>The conclusions of environmental justice literature are not unanimous. Many studies conclude that minorities do experience a disproportionate toxicity or pollution burden (Gilbert and Chakraborty, 2011; Fisher, Kelly and Romm, 2006; Kravitz-Wirtz et al., 2016), others find that economic class accounts for most of the difference in experienced toxicity (Anderton et al., 1994), yet others find no significant differences at all (Hunter et al., 2003; Downey, 2007). The incredibly heterogeneous results have led to some dissent, with some arguing that all the field has achieved is to show that “in <strong>some</strong> specific areas, <strong>some</strong> ostensibly identifiable groups <strong>may</strong>, in <strong>some</strong> instances, live closer to <strong>some selected</strong> environmental hazards” (Bowen, 2002, emphasis added).</p>
<p>These discordant results are likely rooted in the past availability of data in environmental justice research and the field’s relationship with advocacy. Environmental justice research is unique in that research and advocacy have gone hand in hand, leading to research guided by the needs of communities. This has led to an unusually focused body of work, evaluating specific communities for the presence of specific toxins at specific times (Sadd et al., 1999; US GAO, 1893; Moghadam and Kayahan, 2017; Gilbert and Chakraborty, 2011). Though some work has had a broader net, few authors have broached national data (Ringquist, 1997; Hunter et al., 2003) and even fewer have used data spanning significant time (Kravitz-Wirtz et al., 2016). Due to the definitions of pollution used, uncertainty in pollution data, and differing geographic units of analysis, work spanning broader time periods and geographic regions is necessary to show the existence of environmental inequality on a national scale and begin to understand the processes that lead to environmental inequality.</p>
<p>Despite differing conclusions from the collective body of research, how we define and think about environmental justice is evolving. Several theories of how environmental injustices are created have arisen. The main theories on the origin of environmental injustice are economic, sociopolitical, and discriminatory explanations. What follows is an overview of past environmental justice research and theory, computational background is included in Chapter 5.</p>
<div id="economic-explanations" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Economic Explanations</h2>
<p>Theories focusing on economic aspects of environmental inequality rely on individual and industrial rational choice as an explanation. In the case of facility point source pollution, companies must make economically rational decisions when siting facilities. Those decisions can be multifaceted: if the location has easy access to transportation, or is close to raw materials, but a primary concern is cost of land. Given companies prefer siting polluting facilities on cheap land, and minority communities are frequently near cheap land (Anderton et al., 1994), it’s rational that there would be more facility siting in minority areas.</p>
<p>In the same vein, it would be economically rational for those with the means to escape newly sited pollution to do so (Hunter et al., 2003). Under this theory, cheaper land is more likely to be near minority communities, facilities will be sited there, and those who can afford to escape do so, devaluing the land further, and making it all the more attractive for facility siting. This would create a spiral that results in areas that act as wells for toxicity. Results have been mixed: several studies found that more facilities were sited in minority communities (Crowder and Downey, 2010), while others didn’t (Pais et al., 2013).</p>
</div>
<div id="sociopolitical-explanations" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Sociopolitical Explanations</h2>
<p>Sociopolitical explanations also rely upon siting decisions, but are more explicitly exploitative. Sociopolitical explanations theorize that companies choose to site in minority communities, as at risk communities will provide less resistance. At risk communities could be communities that show a lower voter turnout, have a large older population, are disproportionately renters, or are poorly politically represented. In theory, communities with lower organizing potential are more attractive for facility siting, as they pose a low risk of creating political or economic resistance to the proposed facility.</p>
</div>
<div id="racial-discrimination" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Racial Discrimination</h2>
<p>Racial discrimination theories are divided in to overt and institutional racism theories. In discussion of these theories the language used tends to change, using the term ‘environmental racism’ rather than ‘environmental justice’.</p>
<p>The overt discrimination theory speculates that siting decisions are made to intentionally cause strife to minority communities or to protect wealthy white communities.</p>
<p>The institutional discrimination theory operates primarily on housing dynamics. Based on the knowledge that the number of minority individuals living near a sited facility has risen since first measured (Crowder et al., 2010), the theory states that minorities move towards polluting facilities due to reduced choice in the housing market. Reduced choice can arise in the choices realtors make in showing homes or the availability of mortgages. Local governments can compound problems with housing, as minority areas are more likely to be rezoned for industrial purposes by local government (Pais et al., 2013).</p>
<p>These three theories all point to the same outcome. Despite using different language and explanations, all represent different forms of institutional discrimination. Economic explanations rely on the segregation of minority communities created by redlining. Redlining destroyed investment in communities, prevented black families from investing in homes, and enforced segregated communities. Redlining created the geography and culture that enables economic and sociopolitical explanation, making it a consequence of previous overt discrimination.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Goals</h1>
<p>This work aims to address some of the limitations of the current environmental justice literature by examining a comprehensive data set that covers the entire nation, with data spanning from 1988 to 2015. The broad temporal and spatial coverage is nearly unparalleled in environmental justice literature, with the last study of this length spanning the years 1970 to 1994 (Been and Gupta, 1997), relying solely upon tract level hazardous waste site data.</p>
<p>The goals of this paper are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To build empirical distributions of toxicity experienced by the American public. Using those distributions to find empirical 5<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>, and 95<sup>th</sup> percentiles of experienced toxicity for white, black, and Hispanic populations over time. Rather than examining the mean of each group, these percentiles give us an idea of which groups have access to areas with low toxicity, which groups are most at risk for extreme toxicity (which is most likely to relate to lifestyle or health effects,) and an idea of how the median changes for each group.</p></li>
<li><p>Simulating how minority distributions would look in 2015 given they had held constant their relative position in the overall distribution of 1990. This measure allows us to see how much of the improvement in relative toxicity is attributable to the compression of the overall toxicity distribution, and how much is attributable to changes in the relative state of minority groups.</p></li>
<li><p>To create a web app that provides a searchable map database with information on local toxicity, and the local state of environmental justice. The goal of this app is to make complex data accessible for public use. Additionally, to create a package containing functions that help convert RSEI dissaggregated microdata to a consistent Census compatible form, in order to make the base data more accessible.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Risk Screening Environmental Indicators Model Data</h2>
<p>The Risk Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) Model is a geographically detailed data set produced by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). RSEI data is based upon the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), a data set on toxic releases in the United States.</p>
<p>TRI data is self reported by facilities, with each observation being a release of a reporting chemical at a reporting facility. For each observation, data is collected on which chemical was released, how much of it was released, and the facility from which it was released. This data is collected for a mandated list of industries, facilities, and chemicals that change over time. For a release to be reported it has to be a mandated chemical, released by a mandated facility in a mandated industry.</p>
<p>The detailed location and chemical data that is collected through TRI is reformatted through a fate and transport model to create RSEI. The RSEI data shows where each release has traveled, from its initial point of release, on an 800m by 800m grid across the USA. The ultimate data is an observation for each release, for each square in the grid that the release hits. This gives us an idea of how the chemicals spread from the source locations, and enables us to create a map across the entire nation for where TRI chemicals accumulate in any year between 1988 and 2014. This is a much improved measure of pollution, as it theoretically shows the amount of toxins experienced in any given location.</p>
<p>The initial RSEI disaggregated microdata is approximately 4 terabytes of data. Given that the 800m by 800m grid across the United States has on the order of 10 million squares, each release hits many squares, we have many releases, and the data covers 24 years, this is an enormous data set.</p>
<p>The RSEI reformat of the TRI contains the following variables: X and Y are the geographic identifiers for the cell on the grid across the US, with (0, 0) in the center of the US. Release number tells us which release that row is associated with. Chemical number through media are all release specific data. Conc (concentration) is specific to the release at that square, indicating the concentration of the chemical across that grid cell. ToxConc is the toxicity weighted concentration of that release in that grid cell. ‘Score’ variables are toxicity values as weighted by the population in that grid cell.</p>

<div id="important-caveats" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Important Caveats</h2>
<p>Due to the nature of the data, there are a few interesting caveats to consider.</p>
<p>The RSEI data is self reported, and has been thought to contain some severe under reporting (De Marchi and Hamilton, 2006). This could lead to low estimates of toxicity, and could bias results if certain areas or industries are more likely to under report. Highly regulated chemicals may be more likely to be under reported, as facilities are incentivized to release as little as possible.</p>
<p>The data is entirely based off a black box fate and transport model. The model has uncertainty that is not reported in RSEI and therefore is not being addressed. The raw data we use are estimates to begin with, but are being treated as observed data.</p>
<p>The data only captures releases for certain facility types within certain industries, for certain chemical types within those facilities. Not all chemicals are mandated reporting, and any analysis that is done based off the data can’t be extrapolated to discuss toxicity more generally. Some important industries (like mining) are not monitored over the entire period, and are removed to ensure consistency over time, so areas that strongly represent those industries will have deflated toxicity estimates.</p>
<p>Because RSEI only captures a specific subset of chemicals, it is difficult to relate the RSEI scores to health or quality of life outcomes in an area. There are many obvious environmental hazards that are likely to have strong influence on public health and living conditions that TRI doesn’t address, eg: brownfields, solid waste disposal, animal farming, hazardous waste, etc.</p>
<p>Another detail of the data that makes interpreting results difficult is how chemicals are compared. RSEI gives the weight of the release and the chemical of the release, but chemicals have very different levels of toxicity. A small amount of mercury released is much worse than a small amount of CO2. To that end, the EPA assigned each chemical a ‘toxicity’ weight, by which the amount of the chemical released is multiplied. This means that we can aggregate all the chemicals in an area, and compare the overall toxicity over space and time. The toxicity weights allow us to compare to other chemicals’ toxicity weight, and overall toxicity of a given chemical release, but also means that the values only have meaning in comparison.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations that the data presents, it provides an incredibly detailed and complex view of toxicity in the United States that is worth delving in to.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-continuity" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Data Continuity</h2>
<div id="census-comparability" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Census Comparability</h3>
<p>RSEI data is available between 1988 and 2015, and over that time Census geographies have experienced considerable overhaul. Many of our questions of interest involve demographic characteristics, and the changes we see in environmental toxicity over time for those demographics. As such, we need aggregate toxicity to block group or tract level in order to merge with Census data. To do so, we calculate the toxicity values in Census 2010 geography. Since we want to use Census areas as the unit of analysis, we use crosswalks that help us transform past Census data to the 2010 geographies.</p>
</div>
<div id="chemical-consistency" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Chemical Consistency</h3>
<p>Consistency across time, space, and chemicals is vital in order to be able to compare toxicity values across time. Though the EPA is incredibly detailed in their data collection, they are also subject to changing scientific consensus and legislation, and therefore haven’t been able to provide entirely consistent data.</p>
<p>Over time, as chemicals have been found to be toxic, they have been added to the list of TRI mandated reporting chemicals. There are also chemicals that have been removed from the mandated reporting list. Because the list of chemicals reported changes over time, aggregating all the data would cause us to see artificial jumps in toxicity. These jumps wouldn’t be reflective of actual increases in toxicity, but rather toxicity that was beginning to be measured. These jumps may change what areas appear toxic in the data, as industries that don’t have to report at some point in the time frame will be entirely removed from the data set. Several of those industries are very highly polluting, and after elimination locations that focus strongly on those industries will show deflated scores.</p>
</div>
<div id="industry-reporting-consistency" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.3</span> Industry Reporting Consistency</h3>
<p>TRI regulates who needs to self report using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and before NAICS was available used its predecessor, the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. Just as we see changes in the regulations for chemicals, we see changes in the regulations of various industries. NAICS codes that need to report are regulated independently of chemical codes, and NAICS codes that are not consistently reported across the time period of interest must be removed to maintain continuity.</p>
<p>As an example, a textiles facility releasing mercury might fall under mandated reporting due to their NAICS code, but the neighboring mining facility that also releases mercury might not have to report because of the NAICS code. If that changes over the time period, and suddenly the mining industry also mandates reporting, we will see an artificial huge jump in the mercury present in that area if we don’t remove by industry.</p>
