* Fisher J. B., Kelly M. & Romm J. (2006). Scales of environmental justice: Combining GIS and spatial analysis for air toxics in West Oakland, California. *Health & Place, 12*, pp. 701-714.
    * Uses data from the ISCST3 air dispersion model, and local knowledge of non-point soureces of diesel emissions in West Oakland.
    * Does a disparate impact analysis based on the EPA's 
    * Proves that the point sources are not randomly dispersed accros the Bay area, let alone the Oakland area, and shows statistically significant clusters of facilities.

    * Uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), and data on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) from the Toxic Resource Inventory (TRI) and the Air Quality System (AQS).
    * Find that "Blacks and Latinos are, on average, more likely to be exposed to higher levels of NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 than Whites."
    * More specifically, examines the "correspondence between neighborhood racial composition and pollution levels" using the household level data in PSID.
    * Additionally uses measures of population density and residential segregation (measured using multigroup entropy index) of the areas each of the households are located in. 
    * Uses a multilevel repeated measures model. Level 1 is individual intercepts and slopes, Level 2 is the average of all intercepts and slopes, with coefficients for race and time, Level 3 accounts for metropolitan areas. 
    * Conclusions: There are substantial racial differneces in exposure to several kinds pollution. This persists even for households in similar circumstances. Declines in pollution over time have gone predominantly to minority groups. 
    * Future work: Disentangle if differences come from "racially distinct patterns of individual mobility", "neighborhood change", or industrial siting.
