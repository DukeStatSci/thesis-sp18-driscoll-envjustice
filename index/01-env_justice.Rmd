# Theoretical Background {#env_justice}

The growing body of environmental literature strives to show that minorities in America experience a higher pollution level on average than the white population. The literature has focused primarily on air pollution and industrial facilities releases, the two areas with the most consistently accessible data. Many authors have focused on point source pollution, measuring individual pollution as a binary: the presence or absence of a polluting facility in the geographic unit of analysis (Szasz and Meuser, 1997). An alternate measure of pollution exposure has been the count of polluting facilities within increasingly large buffer zones. These measures, limited by available data, fail to account for the variance in what chemicals, and how much of them, facilities emit. Alternate approaches have included data on transportation emissions and broader environmental data, like levels of NO2 and PM2.5. 

Environmental justice literature results are not all in agreement. Many studies conclude that minorities do experience a disproportionate toxicity or pollution burden (Gilbert and Chakraborty, 2011; Fisher, Kelly and Romm, 2006; Kravitz-Wirtz et al., 2016), others find that economic class accounts for most of the difference in experienced toxicity (Anderton et al., 1994), yet others find no significant differences (Hunter et al., 2003; Downey, 2007). The incredibly heterogeneous results have led to some dissent in the academic community, with some saying that all the field has achieved is to show that "in **some** specific areas, **some** ostensibly identifiable groups **may**, in **some** instances, live closer to **some** selected environmental hazards" (Bowen, 2002, emphasis added).

These comments are likely rooted in enviornmental justice research's relationship to advocacy. Environmental justice research is unique in that research and advocacy have gone hand in hand, leading to questions guided by the needs of communities. This trend has led to an unusually focused body of work, evaluating specific communities for the presence of specific toxins at specific times (Sadd et al., 1999; US GAO, 1893; Moghadam and Kayahan, 2017; Gilbert and Chakraborty, 2011). Though some work has had a broader net, few authors have broached national data (Ringquist, 1997; Hunter et al., 2003) and even fewer have used data spanning significant time (Kravitz-Wirtz et al., 2016). Due to the definitions of pollution being used, uncertainty in accessible pollution data, and differing geographic units of analysis, work spanning broader time periods and geographic regions is necessary to show the existence of environmental racism and begin to understand the processes operating on a national scale that lead to environmental inequality.

Despite differing conclusions from the collective body of research, how we define and think about environmental justice is evolving. Alongside descriptive studies that investigate specific pollution trends, theories of how environmental injustices are created have arisen. The main theorized explanations for environmental injustice are economic, sociopolitical and discriminatory explanations. What follows is an overview of past environmental justice reserach, computational background is included in Chapter 5.

## Economic Explanations

Theories focusing on economic explanations for environmental inequality rely on individual rational choice as an explanation. Especially in the case of point source pollution, companies must make economically rational decisions when siting facilities. Those decisions can be multifaceted: if the location has easy access to transportation, or is close to raw materials, but a primary concern is cost of land. Given companies want cheap land for polluting facilities, and minority communities tend to be near cheap land (Anderton et al., 1994), it's rational that there would be more facility siting in minority areas. 

In the same vein, it would be economically rational for those with the means to escape newly sited pollution to do so (Hunter et al., 2003). Under this theory, cheaper land is more likely to be near minority communities, facilities will be sited there, and those who can afford to escape do so, devaluing the land further, and making it all the more attractive for facility siting. Despite the direct cause and effect theorized, results have been mixed. Several studies found that more facilities were sited in minority communities (Crowder and Downey, 2010), while others didn't (Pais et al., 2013). 

## Sociopolitical Explanations

Sociopolitical explanations also rely upon siting decisions, but are more explicitly exploitative. Sociopolitical explanations theorize that companies rationally chose to site in minority communities, as at risk communities will provide less resistance. At risk communities would show a lower voter turnout, have a large older population, may be disproportionately renters, and may be poorly politically represented. In theory, communities with lower organizing potential are more attractive for facility siting, as they pose a low risk of creating political or economic resistance to the proposed facility. 

## Racial Discrimination

Racial discrimination theories are divided in to overt and institutional racism theories. In discussion of these theories the language used tends to change, using the term 'environmental racism' rather than 'environmental justice'. 

The overt discrimination theory speculates on the intentions of the individuals making the final siting decisions. In this case, overt racism refers to the siting decisions as choices made to intentionally cause strife to minority communities or protect wealthy white communities. 

The institutional discrimination theory relies primarily on housing dynamics. Based on the knowledge that the number of minority individuals living near a sited facility has risen since first measured (Crowder et al., 2010), the theory states that minorities move towards polluting facilities due to reduced choice in the housing market. Reduced choice can arise in several ways: the choices realtors make in showing homes or the availability of mortgages or loans. Local governments can compound the problems with housing, as minority areas are more likely to be rezoned for industrial purposes by local government (Pais et al., 2013). 

These three theories all boil down to the same outcome. Despite using different language and explanations, all represent different forms of institutional discrimination. Economic explanations rely on the segregation of minority communities created by redlining. Redlining destroyed investment in communities, prevented black families from investing in homes, and enforced segregated communities. Redlining created the geography and culture that enables economic and sociopolitical explanation, making it a consequence of previous overt discrimination.

Though the current theories of siting choices would all create the same behavior, the different reasonings can help to explain (and perhaps change) the trends that lead to environmental injustice. 

# Goals 

This work aims to address some of the limitations of the current environmental justice literature by examining a comprehensive dataset that covers the entire nation, with data spanning from 1990 to 2013. The broad temporal and spatial coverage is nearly unparalleled in environmental justice literature, with the last study of this length spanning the years 1970 to 1994 (Been and Gupta, 1997), which relied only upon tract level hazardous waste site data. 

Several questions will be addressed:

* Finding the empirical 5^th^, 50^th^, and 95^th^ percentiles of experienced toxicity for white, black, and Hispanic populations over time. These percentiles give us an idea of which groups have access to areas with low toxicity, which groups are most at risk at the high end of the distribution, and an idea of how the median changes for each group. 

* Simulating how minority distributions would currently look given they had held constant their relative position in the overall distributions. This measure allows us to see how much of the improvement we see is attributable to the compression of the overall toxicity distribution, and how much improvement is attributable to changes in the relative state of minority groups. 

* A web app that provides a searchable map database with information on local toxicity, and the local state of environmental justice. The goal of this app is to make complex data accessible for public use.
