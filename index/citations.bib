@article{Ard2015,
abstract = {In recent decades there have been dramatic declines in industrial air toxins. However, there has yet to be a national study investigating if the drop has mitigated the unequal exposure to industrial toxins by race and social class. This paper addresses this by developing a unique dataset of air pollution exposure estimates, by aggregating the annual fall-out location of 415 air toxins, from 17,604 facilities, for the years 1995 to 2004 up to census block groups (N=216,159/year). These annual estimates of exposure were matched with census data to calculate trends in exposure for different racial and socioeconomic groups. Results show that exposure to air toxins has decreased for everyone, but African-Americans are consistently more exposed than Whites and Hispanics and socioeconomic status is not as protective for African-Americans. These results by race were further explored using spatially specified multilevel models which examine trends over time and across institutional boundaries.},

@article{Burwell-Naney2013,
abstract = {According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Superfund is a federal government program implemented to clean up uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. Twenty-six sites in South Carolina (SC) have been included on the National Priorities List (NPL), which has serious human health and environmental implications. The purpose of this study was to assess spatial disparities in the distribution of Superfund sites in SC. The 2000 US census tract and block level data were used to generate population characteristics, which included race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), education, home ownership, and home built before 1950. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used to map Superfund facilities and develop choropleth maps based on the aforementioned sociodemographic variables. Spatial methods, including mean and median distance analysis, buffer analysis, and spatial approximation were employed to characterize burden disparities. Regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between the number of Superfund facilities and population characteristics. Spatial coincidence results showed that of the 29.5{\%} of Blacks living in SC, 55.9{\%} live in Superfund host census tracts. Among all populations in SC living below poverty (14.2{\%}), 57.2{\%} were located in Superfund host census tracts. Buffer analyses results (0.5mi, 1.0mi, 5.0mi, 0.5km, 1.0km, and 5.0km) showed a higher percentage of Whites compared to Blacks hosting a Superfund facility. Conversely, a slightly higher percentage of Blacks hosted (30.2{\%}) a Superfund facility than those not hosting (28.8{\%}) while their White counterparts had more equivalent values (66.7{\%} and 67.8{\%}, respectively). Regression analyses in the reduced model (Adj. R2 = 0.038) only explained a small percentage of the variance. In addition, the mean distance for percent of Blacks in the 90th percentile for Superfund facilities was 0.48mi. Burden disparities exist in the distribution of Superfund facilities in SC at the block and census tract levels across varying levels of demographic composition for race/ethnicity and SES.},

We address these gaps through a case study that examines: (a) whether potential health risks from exposure to hazardous air pollutants in Florida are related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, and (b) how the significance of statistical associations between health risk and race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status vary across the state. This study integrates census tract level estimates of cumulative cancer risk compiled by the EPA with Census 2000 data and a spatial statistical technique known as geographically weighted regression that allows us to explore spatial variability in analytical results. Our findings indicate that while race and ethnicity are significantly related to cancer risks in Florida, conventional regression can hide important local variations in statistical relationships relevant to environmental justice analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) addresses uncontrolled and abandoned hazardous waste sites throughout the country. Sites that are perceived to be a significant threat to both surrounding populations and the environment can be placed on the U.S. EPA Superfund list and qualify for federal cleanup funds. The equitability of the Superfund program has been questioned; the representation of minority and low-income populations in this cleanup program is lower than would be expected. Thus, minorities and low-income populations may not be benefiting proportionately from this environmental cleanup program. In 1994 President Clinton signed Executive Order 12898 requiring that the U.S. EPA and other federal agencies implement environmental justice policies. These policies were to specifically address the disproportionate environmental effects of federal programs and policies on minority and low-income populations. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS I use event history analysis to evaluate the impact of Executive Order 12898 on the equitability of the Superfund program. DISCUSSION Findings suggest that despite environmental justice legislation, Superfund site listings in minority and poor areas are even less likely for sites discovered since the 1994 Executive Order. CONCLUSION The results of this study indicate that Executive Order 12898 for environmental justice has not increased the equitability of the Superfund program.},

In particular, I evaluate claims that risks from TRI facilities are concentrated in poor and minority areas, holding constant multiple background characteristics that may also account for the distribution of these risks. Methods. A series of probit, negative binomial event count, and weighted least squares models are used to account for the distribution and density of TRI facilities and the concentrations of TRI pollutants in all residential ZIP codes across the United States. Results. Even when controlling for background factors, TRI facilities and pollutants are concentrated in residential ZIP codes with large minority populations. Moreover, while other background characteristics provide the most powerful explanations for the distribution and density of TRI facilities and the concentration of TRI pollutants, the racial attributes of neighborhoods— more than their class attributes— best account for the remaining patterns in the distribution of environmental risk. Conclusions. These results provide additional evidence that racial minorities experience disproportionate proximity to a wide variety of environmental risks. The results also suggest the racial composition of residential neighborhoods as a relevant criterion when approving the location of new TRI facilities.},
